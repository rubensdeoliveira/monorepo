## :pencil: About Challenge

Monorepo is a structure that allows to maintain several subprojects within the same repository. In this repository there are three subprojects that form a main project, namely the server, the web version and the mobile version.

There are several advantages to using monorepo, such as code sharing between subprojects, unified test management, unified package management, etc.
